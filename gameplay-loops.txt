> after basic scaffolding, thinking about doing this a more organic way, currently i'm in this stage of my roadmap - 

🧱 Next Steps in the Dev Pipeline:
We're entering the Lighting & Field of View (FOV) zone:

1. Store/track walkability and visibility data
We’ll use the build_walkability_grid() output to power FOV + lighting logic.

Could store this grid in memory per loaded map (not JSON yet unless we need persistence).

2. Setup FOV system
Use something like shadowcasting or recursive raycasting (Godot-friendly).

Based on blocks_vision from terrain/objects.

Player gets visible area grid after moving.

3. Basic Lighting Overlay
Add a ColorRect or shader overlay for darkness.

Remove darkness from visible tiles based on FOV.

Add a “light radius” to the player (e.g. lanterns).

- anyway i was thinking at some point, it would be good to maybe shift towards specific gameplay loops, could you help me setup milestones from where i'm at to loops like this: 


- Angler Loop (basic early game wilderness survival - eating, drinking, sleeping, earning)
	- getting wood and stones and plant fiber - interacting with objects (bushes and rocks) also maybe special action - searching? 
	- making a axe (for more wood faster) - crafting new gear with component items
	- making a knife (for butchering fish) - crafting new gear with component items
	- making a spear (for defending from animals) - crafting new gear with component items
	- making a rod (for catching fish) - crafting new gear with component items
	- making a shovel (for digging worms) - crafting new gear with component items
	- making a hammer (for building objects) - crafting new gear with component items
	- dig for worms - interacting with terrain (with correct gear in hand only - shovel)
	- make a campfire and primitive shelter (building and placing objects, which consumes items)
	- catch fish - interacting with terrain (with correct gear in hand only - rod, water tile becomes "exploited" can't refish at same spot over and over, have to move on)
	- butcher fish - processing / interacting with component item if certain gear is available (cutting type gear - knife, axe) - best done thru crafting menu?  (raw fish into fish meat)
	- cook fish on campfire - cooking / interacting with object that changes one component item into another component item (fish meat into cooked fish), need wood for fuel
	- eat fish / drink water - eating / drinking actions - get sick from unboiled water?
	- sleep in primitive shelter, may be awoke by animals approach - sleeping action with random outcomes
	- defend self if animal attacks - basic combat, close and some range with spear, spear can be thrown?
	- remember place where campfire / sheleter is - remember place logic, saving a map and returning 
	- go find fish market in town to sell extra fish - looking for vendors / selling to vendors, have to explore city biomes, may need ports? 
	- buy better rod? buy lures? buy cooking pot? buy fishing hat and jacket - buy from vendor / shopping, looking for fishing vendor, have to explore city biomes, may need ports?
	- repeat & scale
	
- Junkman loop (basic early game urban survival - eating, drinking, sleeping, earning)
	- search garbage cans for rags, broken glass, scrap metal (other worthless junk) - interacting with objects / need to be sure cant be exploited, searching same garbage can over and over
	- search alleys for broken furniture - requires exploring more city biomes, traveling
	- scrap broken furniture for wood - turning an item into another item, maybe should require workbench? need to find a factory or workshop in slum with workbench? 
	- make axe, knife, spear, hammer from scrap metal and wood - basic crafting, turning component items into gear
	- make a fishing net from rag strips and wood - used like a fishing rod for catching items in sewer water without getting sick
	- go hunt rats in sewer - basic combat, close and some range with spear, spear can be thrown? 
	- butcher rats with knife - basic crafting, turning component item into cookable item if certain gear is available (cutting type gear - knife, axe)(rat carcass into rat meat)
	- cook rats on hobo campfires in alleys and sewer - have to find public oil drum stove in alley or sewer, need to fuel with wood - turning (rat meat into cooked rat meat)
	- sleep in hobo camps (careful, may get robbed for money or items) - sleeping action with random outcomes
	- search garbage piles and in sewer water for things to sell - (mostly junk but it adds up, sometimes you find a gold ring or something siilar of moderate value)  - interacting with objects / need to be sure cant be exploited, searching same garbage can over and over
	- buy a cheap lock from locksmith - find locksmith vendor by exploring biomes, maybe make it more common someplaces? 
	- find an abandoned apartment or ramshackle - find by exploring biomes, need to have logic for determining "unclaimed" urban places
	- claim apartment with cheap lock
	- remember place where claimed residence is - remember place logic, saving a map and returning
	- build Ragpile Mattress for sleeping, oil drum stove for cooking - building and placing objects in claimed space
	- repeat & scale
